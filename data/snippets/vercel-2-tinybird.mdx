Checkout the [repository](https://github.com/Gabrielpanga/vercelapi2tinybird) for specifications on how to run it.

## Intro

The goal of this project is to track API requests into Tinybird data pipeline, providing an easy way for your users to understand their activity/logs from your API.

## Usage

To setup this project on your vercel application you can easily configure it following the readme file where you will:

<Step number={1} title="Configure Upstash Kafka" />
Setup a *Upstash* account to configure a Kafka topic to listen to all events your api will trigger.

<Step number={2} title="Configure Tinybird's Datasource" />
Configure Tinybird's data ingestion to collect the events received through kafka and store it on a data source to be exposed by APIs.

<Step number={3} title="Configure Nextjs's Middleware" />
Using Next.JS middleware you can track server side api calls, tracking user's footprint and requests performances, sending the events to upstash.
