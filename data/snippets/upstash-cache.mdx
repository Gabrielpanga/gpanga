Checkout the [repository](https://github.com/Gabrielpanga/vercel-upstash-tokens-cache) for specifications on how to run it.

## Intro

When communicating with microservices with Auth0 you will be required to generate tokens to communicate between services.
Even though Auth0 allows for tokens to expire based on the configurations you need (1day - 30 days) 
on serverless architecture you will end up generating one per request due to stateless design.

The goal is an easy way to manage tokens on Upstash redis services between vercel api & other api authenticated with auth0.

## Usage

To setup this project on your vercel application you can easily configure it following the readme file where you will:

<Step number={1} title="Configure Upstash Redis" />
Setup a *Upstash* account to configure Redis to store the Access Tokens generated from auth0.

<Step number={2} title="Configure Auth0" />
Configure a free *Auth0* account to authenticate & authroize api request
